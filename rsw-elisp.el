;;; Commentary:

;;   This code improves and replaces the GNU Emacs commands that
;;   interactively evaluate Emacs Lisp expressions.  The new commands
;;   replace standard key bindings and are all prefixed with `rsw-elisp-'.
;;   They work the same way as the old commands when called non-interactively;
;;   only the interactive behavior should be different, as described below.

;;   To set up to use this every Emacs session, first install this package
;;   with an Emacs package manager and then add the following to your
;;   Emacs initialization file:
;;
;;     (require 'rsw-elisp)
;;     (rsw-elisp-enable)
;;
;;   Or you can test it out the remapped key bindings of all of the
;;   interactive Emacs Lisp evaluation commands and a few minibuffer
;;   helper commands, with:
;;
;;     M-x rsw-elisp-enable RET
;;
;;   To return to the standard key bindings, use:
;;
;;     M-x rsw-elisp-disable RET

;;   The commands and key bindings herein provide 5 new features for
;;   interactive Emacs Lisp evaluation:
;;
;;     1.  Evaluating Quoted Expressions: C-x C-e (eval-last-expression) on
;;         a regularly quoted sexpression doesn't show you anything
;;         different than what you see on screen already.  You really want
;;         to see the value of the unquoted sexpression and now you can.
;;         C-x C-e (rsw-elisp-eval-last-expression) and
;;         M-: (rsw-elisp-eval-expression) remove any regular outer quotes
;;         from sexpressions and show you the value.  For example,
;;         'emacs-version interactively yields "26.0.50".
;;
;;         This is for programmers who already understand how quoting
;;         works and don't need to see the same expression fed back to
;;         them.  For times where you really need to see the quoted
;;         form, use a backquote ` or a backquote followed by a
;;         regular quote '.
;;
;;     2.  Evaluating Function Symbols: When interactively evaluating a
;;         symbol, Emacs returns only the symbol's value, giving an unbound
;;         error if it is not defined.  But if it is a function symbol in
;;         such a case, you typically want to see its function binding, so
;;         these functions return that when the symbol is bound as a
;;         function (or a macro) but not a variable.
;;
;;     3.  Redefining Variables: Interactively calling
;;         `eval-last-expression' with point after a previously defined
;;         variable definition does not reset its value in Emacs, though
;;         clearly the only reason to do this is to redefine the variable.
;;         Although `eval-defun' does do this, there is no reason to have to
;;         use a different key binding than you would to interactively
;;         evaluate other expressions.  C-x
;;         C-e (rsw-elisp-eval-last-expression) resolves this.
;;
;;     4.  Default Expressions to Evaluate: When using M-: bound
;;         to (rsw-elisp-eval-expression), if a region
;;         is active, the leading expression in the region is used as the
;;         default expression to evaluate and included in the prompt.
;;         Otherwise, if called with point in an Emacs Lisp mode listed in
;;         `rsw-elisp-modes' and not on a whitespace character, then the
;;         expression around point is used as the default.
;;
;;     5.  Editing Default Expressions: If you ever want to edit the
;;         default, use M-y (rsw-elisp-yank-pop) to yank it into the
;;         editable portion of the minibuffer, any time other than
;;         after a yank command.  (M-y still performs its normal
;;         yank-pop function as well after a C-y yank).  If you yank a
;;         large expression in by mistake, press C-d or DELETE FORWARD
;;         when at the end of the minibuffer to erase its entire
;;         contents.  If you prefer these helper keys not be bound,
;;         after the call to:
;;           (rsw-elisp-enable)
;;         add:
;;           (setq rsw-elisp-helper-keys nil)
